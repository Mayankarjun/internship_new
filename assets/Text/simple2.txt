Disadvantages of Flutter
1. Limited Third-Party Libraries

While Flutter has a growing number of packages and plugins available, the framework is still relatively new, and the number of third-party libraries available for it is limited compared to more established frameworks such as React Native.

2. Steep Learning Curve

The Dart programming language used by Flutter can be challenging for some developers, and there may be a steep learning curve for those who are not already familiar with it.
